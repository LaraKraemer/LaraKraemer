  myStory = """ 
  
  I am a former people manager and tech recruiter 
  who recently switched careers to become a software engineer. 
  My interest in software engineering began while working as a tech 
  recruiter. However, only in January 2024, I began exploring programming
  for real. The book "A Smarter Way to Learn Python" captivated me, and
  I started coding after work every day. By the end of March, I left my previous role.
  
  Now, I've been programming full-time for several months. I started with 
  HTML and CSS classes from freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project, and have since
  focused on an extensive Python course on Udemy. I'm also working on
  an IOT project. I am building a sourdough starter spy with an ESP32 and
  some funky sensors in MicroPython. Check out my repo. I love geeking out
  about my code and getting my hands dirty.
  
  After years of receiving coding lesson invites, I attended my first Codebar
  event in March and have been a regular attendee since. I've also attended
  the Django Girl one-day workshop in April. I am grateful for the 
  supportive community I've joined. In June, I have the honor to attend the
  Developer Conference "Merge" and in July volunteer at WeAreDevelopers.
